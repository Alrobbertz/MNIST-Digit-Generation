# MNIST-Digit-Generation


## Goal
This project implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with [MNIST data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). This project was completed in Python 3 using [Keras](https://keras.io/).

## Models

* Fully-Connected, Feed-Forward Genreator and Discriminator - Showing Very Good results below
* Convolutional Genreator and Discriminator - Untested, needs additional work

## Results
The Feed-Forward model setup showed good results for generating MNIST digits. It is clear there is still some mode collapse, however I amd satisfied with the results of the Genreator. 

The image below shows a sample of 100 random digits generated.
